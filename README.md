# BDR-site_router - A Server Routing System for Modular Sites

## Summary
This is a simple project that seeks to maintain abstraction of lowest-level server interaction while allowing for custom routing code for individual, modular sites.  The repo is intended to be used as a wrapper for a collection of sites.  Currently, this role is filled by [BDR-SITES](https://github.com/wcr3/BDR-SITES), included as a submodule.

## Framework
The project is built on Node.js and is intended to reside on Yale's Spinup Self-Service server platform, allowing for access by permitted users from any system on Yale's network.

Note that, at the moment, this repository is a proof-of-concept, and no Spinup server exists.
