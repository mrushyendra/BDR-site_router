# BDR-site_router - A Simple Server Routing System for Modular Sites

## Summary
The intention of this project is to build an inventory management platform BDR in hopes of vastly decreasing the time/money spent looking for tools and parts.  Future plans include automated BOM creation, integration with design files and integration with Project Management materials.

The hope is that this project will eventually be integrated into a larger-scale system for automation and maintenance of BDR documentation and competition materials, tailored specifically for Formula Hybrid and FSAE.

## Framework
The project is built on Node.js and interfaces with a server-side SQL database of tools, components, and parts.  By running on Yale's Spinup Self-Service server platform, the inventory can be accessed and edited by any permitted users from any system on Yale's network.

Note that, at the moment, this repository is a proof-of-concept, and no Spinup server exists.

## Note
The scope of this project has somewhat grown to a server routing system with LIMBS as an initial showcase.  For that reason I'll probably move it to a more aptly names Repo at some point.
